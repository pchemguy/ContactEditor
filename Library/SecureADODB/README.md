This project proposes several modifications to the [SecureADODB] library, as well as explores alternative design options. Please see *ExamplesDbManager.bas*, *ExamplesDbRecordsetUpdate.bas* (examples using this fork of the SecureADODB library), and *ExamplesPlainADODB.bas* (mostly plain ADODB examples) in "VBAProject\SecureADODB\Examples" for usage examples. SecureADODB examples produce output via Debug.Print and via the QueryTable feature. Plain ADODB module produces very little output, and its results can be examined via the debugger or by modifying the code.

See project [docs][SecureADODB fork] for further details.
