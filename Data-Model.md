At the basis of the project model are two data data model classes, `DataRecordModel`, representing a single Record (table row) shown to the user on the UserForm, and `DataTableModel`, abstracting persistent storage. Model classes know nothing about data storage, which is the responsibility of the backend classes. Presently, each of the two base model classes has one backend, DataRecordWSheet and DataTableWSheet each, in turn, implementing a corresponding storage interface, IDataRecordStorage and IDataTableStorage and generated by their respective abstract factories: DataRecordFactory\IDataRecordFactory and  DataTableFactory\IDataTableFactory. Finally, DataRecordManager\IDataRecordManager and DataTableManager\IDataTableManager incorporate by composition one model and one backend class, yielding a "backend-managed" model.

For present purposes, data needs to be transferred between DataRecordModel and DataTableModel; hence, the need for additional functionality, which should not go in the base classes. Thus, DataCompositeManager class is added. It can be implemented either via a composition of "backend-managed" classes, or via a composition of two model and two backend classes directly. The latter pathway has been chosen for  DataCompositeManager class, and it exposes the necessary features of the constituent classes and implements the "inter-model" functionality. Finally, the viewModel class ContactEditorModel incorporates DataCompositeManager.
