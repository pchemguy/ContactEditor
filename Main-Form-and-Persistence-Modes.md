The main form acts as a table browser, displaying one record at a time. Each form control holding a field value has name matching the name of the field. ContactEditorPresenter transfers the data between the form and RecordTableManager(DataCompositeManager)->RecordModel(DataRecordModel) by matching the names of the controls and field names on DataRecordModel instance. The only place, where the control/field names needed to appear in the code explicitly, is in the code-behind of the form wiring "Change" events handlers for individual controls.  

The UserForm - view/viewModel - ContactEditorForm is displayed as *modeless*, so custom UserForm events to pass control to the appropriate routines in the presenter (ContactEditorPresenter). For this reason, a WithEvents view reference is defined as a module level field in the presenter, and a module level reference to the presenter is defined in the entry point module. Presenter also defines a second view reference as IDialogView interface, containing the main entry point for the view.  

Since UserForm events cannot be programmatically enabled/disabled (at least straightforwardly) at run time, SuppressEvents Boolean flag is added to the ContactEditorModel to cancel event processing when the form fields are programmatically updated.
